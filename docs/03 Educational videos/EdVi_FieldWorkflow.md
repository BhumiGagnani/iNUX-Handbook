# Educational Videos - Workflows

## Real world videos, documentation of field and lab methods

Videos can be easily generated by freely available tools. The required materials can be generated by existing devices (e.g., smartphone and/or camera). Subsequently, the different steps are briefly explained.

1. Develop the plot of the video. The plot describes the sequence of scenes. Scences can be composed of video snippet, pictures, explanatory figures, and more. The plot should provide information about the main content and explanations.

2. Generate and/or organize the raw material for the video. (Possibly this step can be done before step #1)

3. Organize and develop the video with a suitable software, for example (the free the VSCD Free Video Editor)[LINK to VSCD]. More and specific details can be found in the (separate instructions)[LINK HERE]. An example is provided in the workshop section.
