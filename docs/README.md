# The iNUX Handbook

This repository contain information and instructions about how to use and generate innovative educations materials. These material comprise 
* Videos (ranging from field- and lab experiments to software demonstration and written explanations),
* Jupyter Notebooks as interactive documents,
* Digital questions for various types of assessments,
* Enhanced classical educational materials as open source ressources.

The Handbook and workshop instructions are available through the [iNUX Handbook](https://gw-inux.github.io/iNUX-Handbook/). This handbook and workshop files are build up from this repository. They are not representing a final state. Rather, they likely will be enhanced and updated from the iNUX team, but also from the open source community. We are happy for contributions, and to get feedback.
