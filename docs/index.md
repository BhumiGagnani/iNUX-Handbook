# The iNUX Project

The overall aim of iNUX is to enhance interactive understanding of groundwater hydrology and hydrogeology by providing digitally enhanced teaching material like Videos, Jupyter Notebooks, and electronic assessments together with instructions for teachers about how to use the materials and how to contribute to the established material pools. iNUX is an ERASMUS+ cooperation project running from 2022 to 2025. The project is a collaboration of the University Polytecnica Catalunia Barcelona, the Technical University Dresden, and the universities of Gothenburg and Graz. Increasing the number of cooperation partners as well as establishing continuing working groups are further aims of iNUX. More detailed information about the materials, how to use them, and how to cooperate and contribute to the project are available in the specific sections of the page.
