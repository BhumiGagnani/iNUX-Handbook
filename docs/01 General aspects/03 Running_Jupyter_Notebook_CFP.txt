Working with a provided Jupyter notebook (in this example GWF_DCC_CFP_Response)

Prenote: We assume that the required executable (here CFPv2.exe) is available through the path environment

1) Open the notebook with your Jupyter Notebook interface

2) Execute the cells with the run symbol or by pressing 'SHIFT' & 'ENTER' on your keyboard

3) If the notebook stops because some libraries are missing - install them with
	open the command window and install the required library with the command 'PIP install nameoflibrary' (Hint: if you want to install CFPy the required command is 'PIP install CFPy-TUD'
	
4) Go back to the notebook and restart with 'KERNEL' -> 'Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs...'
