## ONYX Question Types

| Question Type                  | Question Description |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Choice interaction             | The choice interaction lets the learner choose from alternative answers. You may define questions as Single Choice (SC) or Multiple Choice (MC). |
| Hotspot interaction            | In a hotspot question the learner has to mark one or more areas in a picture. You may choose between single and multiple choice. |
| Hottext interaction            | The hottext interaction allows you to edit a text with correct and wrong text elements. The learner should recognize the wrong text elements and highlight them. |
| Inline choice                  | Inline choices are dropdown boxes in texts. |
| Match interaction              | The simple assignment interaction offers a two column drag and drop assignment question. |
| Matrix interaction             | The matrix assignment interaction defines a two-dimensional table for assignment between multiple options. |
| Graphic match interaction      | The graphic match interaction allows the placement of elements on given areas of a background graphic. Exactly one element is assigned to one area. |
| Order interaction              | The order interaction allows the learner to order text as well as pictures in a defined ranking. |
| Text entry interaction         | The text entry interaction defines any text that has to be filled in by the learner. |
| Numerical input interaction    | For the numerical entry interaction enter text for which the learner has to fill in the gaps with digits. You can define a fault tolerance in form of a relative or absolute digit area in case you want to include them in the question solution. |
| Calculation interaction        | The calculation interaction is an extended text entry question, especially for numerical input with parameters. As solution define a calculation template based on the parameters used in the task formulation. |
| Formula comparison             | The formula comparison interaction offers the possibility to enter a formula as answer. If enabled the learner gets formula validation. |
| Regular expression             | The type "Regular expression" enables the user to define a dynamic correct solution, which must conform to a regular expression to be fully scored. |
| Extended text interaction      | The extended text interaction offers a large text area and therefore enables the learner to enter longer texts. |
| Upload interaction             | The upload interaction allows the learner to upload a file. |
| Drawing interaction            | The drawing interaction enables the learner to sketch his answer. A background graphic can be specified. |
| Programming interaction        | The programming interaction allows the input of program code. An automatic evaluation can be based on test cases. |
| Molecule drawing interaction   | The molecule drawing interaction enables the learner to sketch chemical compounds and elements. A molecular structure can be specified. |
