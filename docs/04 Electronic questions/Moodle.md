## Moodle Question Types

| Question Type                                                                 | Question Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Multiple Choice                                                                | Users select one or more answers from a list of options. Can be set to allow single or multiple correct answers. Options can include text, images, or multimedia. This is the most common question type for knowledge checks and quizzes. |
| True/False                                                                     | Users choose between just two options: True or False. This format is quick and easy to answer, suitable for straightforward factual statements. |
| Short Answer                                                                   | Users type a word or short phrase as the answer. The system matches input against accepted answers, which can be case-sensitive or insensitive. Great for factual recall or fill-in-the-blank questions where responses are brief. |
| Essay                                                                          | Users write long, open-ended responses. Ideal for complex reasoning, explanations, or reflective answers. Requires manual grading by instructors. Essay answers can be long text and often support multimedia attachments. |
| Matching                                                                       | Users pair items in one list with items in another. Useful for vocabulary, concepts, or process steps, less guessing compared to multiple choice. |
| Numerical                                                                      | Users type a numeric answer; can allow an accepted range (margin of error). Useful for math, physics, and quantitative questions. |
| Calculated / Calculated Simple / Calculated MultiChoice                       | These allow numerical questions that include variables (wildcards). Each student receives different data values randomized within set ranges. Used in science and math exams for unique, calculation-based questions. |
| Drag and Drop (into Text, Marker, onto Image, Matching)                        | Interactive questions where users drag answers (text or images) into the correct places in a sentence, grid, or image. Useful for language learning, diagrams, labeling. |
| Cloze (Embedded Answers)                                                       | Complex questions embedding multiple question types (short answer, multiple choice, numeric) within a passage of text. Allows for integrated, context-based assessment. |
| Description (Not Graded)                                                       | Not a question. Used to insert text, images, or multimedia as instructions or information inside a quiz. No user action required. |
| All-or-Nothing Multiple Choice                                                 | A variation where students must select all and only the correct answers to get any creditâ€”any mistake results in zero points. |
| Gapfill/Select Missing Word                                                    | Users fill gaps in a sentence using dropdowns, text entry, or drag-and-drop. Great for language and technical knowledge testing. |
| CodeRunner                                                                     | For programming code assessment; executes and grades code submissions (where plugin is enabled). |
